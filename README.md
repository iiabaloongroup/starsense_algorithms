# starsense_algorithms
This is a software package for testing and performance evaluation of different star sensors. The algorithms used for calculating quaternions from star field images are : centroiding, geometric voting and QUEST algorithms. The physical parameters of a star sensor are parametrized and by changing these parameters various performance estimators like sky coverage, memory requirement, timing requirements etc can be estimated for the selected star sensor.
